## 👋 Hey, I'm Andrew — aka GPTAlchemist
Estimating Manager turned AI Systems Architect. I build schema-enforced, logic-rigorous GPT tools designed to survive long-form sessions, scale across teams, and anchor real-world workflows. My work bridges estimating, ops strategy, and custom AI integration—with zero fluff and full stack control.

## 🧱 What I Build
I don’t make prompts. I engineer clarity systems. Every tool I build targets a real production weakness—drift, dilution, vagueness, fragility—and replaces it with structure.

### 🔬 GPT Agronomy Protocol
A two-phase adversarial protocol for stress-testing and validating GPT instruction sets:
- **Instruction Alchemist:** Schema-first builder that transforms raw intent into logic-valid scaffolds
- **Instruction Reaper:** Diagnostic attacker that mocks, breaks, and refines fragile instruction sets
- **Outcome:** Production-hardened GPTs ready for volatile, role-sensitive workflows

### 📝 README Synth GPT
Most docs explain. This one enforces. Converts verbose logic, prompt chaos, or dev notes into:
- Structured, publishable READMEs
- Schema-compliant instruction files
- Enterprise-facing clarity with tone-aware modulation

### 🌀 The Driftage Paradox *(WIP)*
An analysis of contextual decay in GPTs over long sessions. Built to:
- Detect signal loss (formatting, tone, logic breakdown)
- Simulate turn-by-turn behavior degradation
- Introduce DriftWarden: a YAML-based recovery and reinforcement tool

## 🧠 How I Think
GPTs don’t break. They erode.

Most systems fail not at the token limit, but under **signal dilution**—a slow bleed where scaffolds fade and GPTs start guessing. My work focuses on **predictable resilience**: testing collapse points, designing schema locks, and embedding self-healing anchors inside the system prompt.

Every tool I build is:
- Schema-first
- Role-aware
- Stress-tested by adversarial subsystems
- Designed to scale without handholding

## 🎯 Who I Help
I'm a fit for AI teams that need:
- Toolsmith-level GPT builders
- Schema enforcement for multi-role GPTs
- Internal clarity layers (docs, guides, modulated instructions)
- Long-form context resilience and drift management

I’ve worked in:
- Defense and electrical infrastructure
- eMobility estimating and automation
- High-pressure proposal ops

And I’m ready to build **real AI infrastructure**—not just demos.

## 📬 Let’s Talk
If you’re building with GPTs at scale, I can help you:
- Harden your instruction logic
- Reduce failure under context pressure
- Make tools that survive beyond demo day
