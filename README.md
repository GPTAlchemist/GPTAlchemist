# 👋 Andrew Polk — aka GPTAlchemist

Estimating Manager turned AI Systems Architect.

I don’t build “prompts.” I build **clarity engines**: schema-enforced, stress-tested GPT systems that survive long-form use, scale across teams, and slot into real-world workflows — no handholding, no hallucinated UX.

## 🧱 What I Actually Build

Every tool I ship replaces a real failure mode:

- **Drift →** Solved with schema locks  
- **Vagueness →** Replaced by role-aligned behavior blocks  
- **Token bloat →** Contained through modular prompts and self-healing anchors  
- **Context collapse →** Exposed and hardened by adversarial logic harnesses

This isn’t prompt engineering. This is systems design — for teams that *can’t afford* brittle GPTs.

## 🔬 GPT Agronomy Protocol

A 2-phase adversarial framework for **constructing**, **breaking**, and **hardening** GPT instruction sets.

### Phase 1: `Instruction Alchemist`  
Builds schema-valid logic from vague intent. Every output is:

- Role-bound and scope-aware  
- Fully scaffolded using enforced YAML schemas  
- Built for modifiability and inspection — not guesswork

### Phase 2: `Instruction Reaper`  
Deliberately breaks what you just built. Reaper simulates:

- Context decay and drift  
- Bad actor prompts and misuse  
- Logic collisions in real workflows

🧱 **Result:** Instruction sets that can be trusted under pressure — not just demo day.

## 📝 README Synth GPT

Most README generators write summaries.  
This one enforces narrative logic, tone alignment, and schema compliance.

Feed it your chaos — docs, bullet dumps, raw prompt logic — and get back:

- Developer-grade Markdown docs  
- Schema-compliant instruction files  
- Enterprise-ready presentation without the fluff

It doesn’t just explain your repo. It **defends** it.

## 🌀 The Driftage Paradox (WIP)

A teardown of how GPTs **fail over time**.

- Simulates signal degradation (tone, formatting, logic)  
- Models long-turn erosion in multi-step assistants  
- Introduces `DriftWarden`: a YAML-based recovery and re-anchoring layer  

🔍 **Core Premise:** GPTs don’t break — they erode. Most teams don’t notice until it’s too late.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

Everything I build follows the same rules:

- **Schema-first logic enforcement**  
- **Adversarial validation baked in**  
- **Explicit formatting & tone control**  
- **System prompts that don’t guess**  
- **Designed to scale without supervision**

This is not “AI tooling.”  
This is **ops-layer infrastructure** for GPT-integrated workflows.

## 🎯 Who I Work With

If you’re shipping GPT tools at scale and need:

- Real schema logic — not loose prompt blocks  
- Drift mitigation and long-form resilience  
- Internal clarity engines (docs, guides, systems)  
- Instruction sets that don’t crack under pressure

Let’s talk.

This README was structured using **README Synth GPT**, a tool I built to convert technical chaos into clean, defensible documentation.  
Everything in here — claims, systems, language — originated from my own work.  
The tool just organized it.
